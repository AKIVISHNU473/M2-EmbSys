 # AUTOMATIC WATER LEVEL CONTROLLER
 
ABSTRACT:
          The main theme of our project is to save water and this project is implemented in such a way that it can detect effeciently the water range upto the threshold value. 
 
 SOFTWARE USED 
 
  SIMULIDE:
         SimulIDE is a simple real time electronic circuit simulator, intended for hobbyist or students to learn and experiment with simple electronic circuits and                         microcontrollers, supporting PIC, AVR and Arduino.
  
  ARDUINO:
         Arduino  is an open-source hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller                kits for building digital devices.


COMPONENTS USED:
 
   # AURDINO UNO:![Aurdino Uno](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98825305/155834209-1cbef921-552c-4883-a824-16d2d2a82ec6.jpg)
    1 The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller.
    2 The board has 14 digital I/O pins , 6 analog I/O pins, and is programmable with the Arduino IDE.
    3 The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards and other circuits.
  
  # ULTRASONIC SENSOR:![ultrasonic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98825305/155834347-4e81f3e8-27a9-4b02-acda-a7eb291d01d8.jpg)
    1 Ultrasonic sensors are devices that generate or sense ultrasound energy. 
    2 They can be divided into three broad categories: transmitters, receivers and transceivers.
    3 Transmitters convert electrical signals into ultrasound, receivers convert ultrasound into electrical signals, and transceivers can both transmit and receive ultrasound.
 
 # SERVO MOTOR:![Servo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98825305/155834442-450020ff-6c11-45e7-aeb0-ddfc220dc88a.png)
    1 A servomotor  is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration.
    2 It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback.
