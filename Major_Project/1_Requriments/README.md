 # AUTOMATIC WATER LEVEL INDICATOR
 
INTRODUCTION:


       1 Automatic water level controllers are a product that was created to automatically control a motor, which helps to ensure a constant reserve of water in a storage tank.   
       2  These automatic water level controllers are used to automatically fill the over-head tank when it starts or has become empty as well as monitor the water level in it.    
 
ABSTRACT:
          The main theme of our project is to save water and this project is implemented in such a way that it can detect effeciently the water range upto the threshold value. 
 
 SOFTWARE USED 
 
  SIMULIDE:
         SimulIDE is a simple real time electronic circuit simulator, intended for hobbyist or students to learn and experiment with simple electronic circuits and                         microcontrollers, supporting PIC, AVR and Arduino.
  
  ARDUINO:
         Arduino  is an open-source hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller                kits for building digital devices.


COMPONENTS USED:
 
   # AURDINO UNO:![Aurdino Uno](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98825305/155834209-1cbef921-552c-4883-a824-16d2d2a82ec6.jpg)
    1 The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller.
    2 The board has 14 digital I/O pins , 6 analog I/O pins, and is programmable with the Arduino IDE.
    3 The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards and other circuits.
  
  # ULTRASONIC SENSOR:![ultrasonic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98825305/155834347-4e81f3e8-27a9-4b02-acda-a7eb291d01d8.jpg)
    1 Ultrasonic sensors are devices that generate or sense ultrasound energy. 
    2 They can be divided into three broad categories: transmitters, receivers and transceivers.
    3 Transmitters convert electrical signals into ultrasound, receivers convert ultrasound into electrical signals, and transceivers can both transmit and receive ultrasound.
 
 # SERVO MOTOR:![Servo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98825305/155834442-450020ff-6c11-45e7-aeb0-ddfc220dc88a.png)
    1 A servomotor  is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration.
    2 It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback. 
    
 # LIGHT EMITTING DIODE :![LED](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98825305/155835931-093b9ae9-2e57-434e-ad09-24834defe6e6.jpg)

    1 A light-emitting diode is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it.
    2 Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons.
 # RESISTOR:![resistor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98825305/155836025-7d6c6960-078d-4946-8c7c-622c9c597555.jpg)

    1 A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.
    2  In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among  other uses.

   # 4W'S & 1H 
   
  # WHO
     
   1 The project can be used almost by all the particular organization people.At the end,user satisfaction is the goal of the project.
     
   # WHAT
   
   1 By this project we can check the water level .
      
   # WHEN
   
   1 This can be used to check the capacity of water content .
      
   # WHERE
   
   1  This can be used in Water tanks , glasses and big jars .
      
   # HOW
   
   1 -> This code is designed in such a way that we have to give certain input value upto which the water level is accepted (Threshold)
   2 -> The tank will be divided accordingly 
   3 -> When ever the water starts filling for every portion.
   4 ->  It will detect by the Ultrasonic sensor which is having transmitter and reciever .
   5 -> If water reaches threshold it detects and elerts us.
