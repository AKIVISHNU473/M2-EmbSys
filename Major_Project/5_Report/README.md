 # AUTOMATIC WATER LEVEL CONTROLLER
 
INTRODUCTION:


       1 Automatic water level controllers are a product that was created to automatically control a motor, which helps to ensure a constant reserve of water in a storage tank.   
       2  These automatic water level controllers are used to automatically fill the over-head tank when it starts or has become empty as well as monitor the water level in it.    
 SOFTWARE USED 
 
  SIMULIDE:
         SimulIDE is a simple real time electronic circuit simulator, intended for hobbyist or students to learn and experiment with simple electronic circuits and                         microcontrollers, supporting PIC, AVR and Arduino.
  
  ARDUINO:
         Arduino  is an open-source hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller                kits for building digital devices.
     
     
  
   # 4W'S & 1H 
   
  # WHO
     
   1 The project can be used almost by all the particular organization people.At the end,user satisfaction is the goal of the project.
     
   # WHAT
   
   1 By this project we can check the water level .
      
   # WHEN
   
   1 This can be used to check the capacity of water content .
      
   # WHERE
   
   1  This can be used in Water tanks , glasses and big jars .
      
   # HOW
   
   1 -> This code is designed in such a way that we have to give certain input value upto which the water level is accepted (Threshold)
   2 ->  when ever the water reaches the certain level it detects .
   3 -> It will detect by the Ultrasonic sensor which is having transmitter and reciever .
   4 -> If water reaches threshold it detects and elerts us.
